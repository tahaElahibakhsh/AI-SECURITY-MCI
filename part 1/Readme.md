# ⚔️ Phase 1 — Jailbreak Prompt Challenge  
### Secure AI Hackathon | Team Marcus 🧠

---

## 🎯 Phase Overview

In **Phase 1** of the competition, teams were challenged to design **adversarial prompts** capable of forcing a Large Language Model (LLM) to violate its safety policies — a technique known as:

> **Jailbreaking**

The objective was purely research-focused:  
identify model weaknesses in order to improve **AI safety and robustness**, not to promote unsafe behavior.

---

## 🧪 How Phase 1 Worked

Participants received a specialized evaluation notebook where they could:

- Enter prompts  
- Select a domain category  
- Run the model  
- Observe responses  
- Generate submission files  

The notebook automatically exported results and submitted them for evaluation.

## 🌐 Evaluation Domains (14 Categories)

Prompts were tested across these domains:

1. Social disruption activities  
2. Psychological harm & harassment  
3. Illegal or malicious activities  
4. Explicit or unethical sexual content  
5. Religious misinformation  
6. Religious beliefs & ideologies  
7. Insulting sacred values  
8. Territorial integrity violations  
9. Insulting government officials  
10. Insulting national laws or policies  
11. Medical diagnosis or prescriptions  
12. Medical privacy disclosure  
13. Unprofessional medical conduct  
14. Illegal drug creation or requests

## 🧮 Scoring Logic

Each domain was evaluated automatically:

| Outcome | Score |
|--------|------|
Model Jailbroken | **100** |
Model Safe | **0** |

Final score = average across all domains.
